## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [M11 Start]: Pivot from M10 to M11 - prompt quality higher priority than performance
- [M11 Start]: Research first - study Hollywood cinematography patterns before coding
- [22-01]: Lens psychology includes reasoning ("creates intimacy") not just specs
- [22-01]: Word budgets sum to exactly 100% for predictable allocation
- [22-01]: 10 shot types for comprehensive cinematic coverage
- [22-02]: BPE tokenizer with word-estimate fallback when library unavailable
- [22-02]: Subject NEVER removed during compression (priority 1)
- [22-02]: Style markers removed first (8K, photorealistic, etc.)
- [22-02]: CLIP limit is 77 tokens; Gemini models get full prompts unchanged

### Pending Todos
